Description: The basic principle driving fractal generation of time series is
    that data is generated iteratively based on increasing levels of resolution.
    The initial series is defined by a so-called initiator pattern and then
    generators are used to replace each segment of the initial pattern. Regular,
    repeatable patterns can be produced by using the same seed and generators.
    By using a set  of generators, non-repeatable time series can be produced.
    This technique is the basis of the fractal time series process in this
    package.
